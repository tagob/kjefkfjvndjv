Prompt for GPT:
Context:

I’m working on creating a simple, easy-to-use system for my dad to manage his small hardware business. My dad owns a shop where he sells hardware tools, power tools, agriculture tools, and related items. His daily sales range from ₹1,000 to ₹60,000, and he deals with around 1,000–1,500 different items in his inventory. He accepts both cash payments and GPay payments. Currently, he manually tracks sales and purchases, and we need to create a system that simplifies this process while also helping him track balances, inventory, and expenses.

Project Goal:

We need to develop an easy-to-use inventory management system that:

Allows my dad to input daily sales and purchases (including payment method: Cash or GPay).
Updates inventory stock automatically as sales and purchases are entered.
Tracks cash balance and GPay balance (with calculations based on sales and purchases).
Provides a daily report that my dad can print easily (either from Google Sheets or via email).
Allows my dad to add pictures and descriptions for each inventory item.
We aim for this system to be simple, free, and accessible from any device (laptop, phone, etc.). The system should also allow my dad to easily understand and manage it without technical knowledge.

System Features:

Sales Tracking:

A form where my dad can input sales data for each day.
Sales entries should include:
Item sold
Quantity sold
Total sale amount
Payment method (Cash or GPay)
Date of sale
This should update the Sales sheet and Inventory sheet in Google Sheets automatically.
Purchase Tracking:

A form to input purchases when new stock arrives.
Purchase entries should include:
Item name
Quantity purchased
Purchase price
Supplier name
Date of purchase
This should update the Purchases sheet and Inventory sheet.
Inventory Management:

A Google Sheet to track all inventory items.
Each item will have fields for:
Item ID
Item name
Description
Purchase price
Selling price
Stock level (automatically updated from sales and purchases)
Image link (to store images of items)
Stock levels should update automatically as sales and purchases are entered.
Each inventory item should have a description box for additional details.
Balance Tracking:

A form to track cash and GPay balances.
Daily updates for the cash balance and GPay balance.
Use Google Sheets functions to calculate and update balances as sales are made (e.g., adding cash sales to the cash balance, subtracting purchases, etc.).
Daily Report:

A Daily Summary sheet that:
Shows the total sales (Cash & GPay).
Displays total purchases for the day.
Displays any daily expenses/charges.
Calculates the net cash and GPay balance for the day.
My dad should be able to print or download this report at the end of each day in a simple format.
The report should include:
Date
Total sales (Cash + GPay)
Total purchases
Total expenses/charges (if any)
Net balance (Cash & GPay)
Google Sheets Integration:

Use Google Sheets as the database for the system (to store inventory, sales, purchases, etc.).
The data from Google Forms (Sales, Purchases, Expenses) will automatically update the relevant Google Sheets tabs.
Use Google Sheets functions for calculations (e.g., stock levels, balances).
Make the Daily Report printable and simple to read.
Image and Description Management:

Allow my dad to upload images of items (e.g., product pictures) directly in the Inventory sheet.
Store image links in Google Drive and link them in the Google Sheets.
Allow for easy text descriptions to be added to each item in the inventory.
Technical Details:

Google Sheets will be the main tool for managing all data, with multiple sheets/tabs for:
Inventory
Sales
Purchases
Expenses/Charges
Balances
Daily Summary/Reports
Google Forms will be used for easy data input (Sales Form, Purchases Form, Expenses Form, Balance Form).
The system should be mobile-friendly and work well on smartphones so my dad can use it on the go.
Google Apps Script can be used to automate some functions (e.g., generating and emailing daily reports).
My dad will access the system via a Google Sheets link and will enter data manually into the forms.
Objective:

Simplify the daily tracking of sales, purchases, and balances for my dad.
Ensure that my dad can easily input data, track inventory, and view daily reports.
Allow easy printing and exporting of sales and purchase reports at the end of each day.
Ensure the system is simple, free, and can be accessed on any device (desktop, laptop, or smartphone).
Additional Context:

My dad’s shop sells hardware tools, power tools, agriculture items, etc.
The business generates anywhere from ₹1,000 to ₹60,000 in sales per day.
Inventory items range from 1,000 to 1,500+ products.
Payments are accepted via cash and GPay (Google Pay).
The card machine also accepts GPay and credit/debit card payments, and sales are recorded on it.
This should provide a comprehensive overview of the project and help GPT understand exactly what needs to be done. The goal is to create a system that’s easy for your dad to use while effectively tracking sales, purchases, inventory, and balances in a simple, organized manner.
